<h1 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>We concluded an interesting interdisciplinary project on
digitalization where we performed some basic data science (web
scraping, elastic search/kibana juggling, counting). I would like to
share some results on this blog.</p>
<p>The project was called &ldquo;DIGITAL COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES FOR THE
CULTURAL SECTOR IN THE BODENSEE REGION&rdquo; and the data analysis module
dealt with the question of how digitisation was actually implemented
using the example of some cultural providers on the region of the Lake
Constance. We use in this article interchangeably Lake of
Constance region and Bodensee region.</p>
<h1 id="motivation">Motivation<a class="headerlink" href="#motivation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The presence in social media channels is an important indicator of the
extent to which a cultural provider has gone digital. It shows how
aware they are of their own image on the
Internet and how they actively deal with it. A popular social media platform is
Instagram. It is easier to access data from there than from Facebook
or Twitter, for example, which is a great advantage. Also data privacy
is less concerning here since people know that it will be shared. We
also gathered data which was only available without access restriction
and will not share it.</p>
<h1 id="instagram">Instagram<a class="headerlink" href="#instagram" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Instagram is a social network service specialized in images. The
exchange takes place via so-called posts, which always consist of a
picture and a description. Users can leave comments on each
post. Every day, 500 million users visit the platform, a total of 1
billion per month, as
<a href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/instagram-statistics/">this link</a>
shows. In Germany Instagram is widely used with around <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1021975/instagram-users-germany/">20 million
users</a>
and we assume that this is also the case in the Bodensee region.</p>
<p>As pointed out earlier, Instagram focuses on images.  This limits the possibilities of user
posts, because some cultural providers do not allow to take pictures
of the exhibitions/performances. On the other hand, the public
relations work of the cultural provider and the experience of the
visitors up to and after the exhibition/performance can be well
documented. Therefore, we expect that  all selected cultural providers
are well represented.</p>
<h1 id="collected-data">Collected data<a class="headerlink" href="#collected-data" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>First, a list of 210 cultural destinations and places, as well as 48
artists and 102 events relevant to the Lake Constance region was
compiled. Then we implemented a software routine to search for and
download relevant Instagram posts and the corresponding comments from
this list. The downloaded data was then stored in a database. Thus, by
the end of July 2019, a total of approximately 300,000 posts had been
collected.</p>
<h1 id="analysis">Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#analysis" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>We noticed that many of the posts were noise: For example, a
restaurant in Porto Alegre - Brazil - is called &ldquo;Mainau&rdquo;, so some
posts contain relevant text but are not directly related to the Lake
Constance region. Also Mainau is only conditionally a cultural
provider but much more touristic (in total 41.246 posts were connected
to Mainau). Therefore, we removed many such terms or refined the
search with an additional local attribute, so that in the end 128,188
posts were used for analysis. Nevertheless, we kept one very large
event, namely #bodensee, so that we can make a comparison with the
Bodensee region as a whole. Unfortunately, #bodensee has more than 1
million post, so we took predominantely the months of June and July
2019 and only a very few samples (around 600 posts) from before that
dates. This is the reason why we will only discuss timelines relating
to the culture providers. Especially, in #bodensee we expect a high
bias towards summer related events/topics.
In the analysis, we summarize all searched
terms of the list and only speak of searched events, if not explicitly
subdivided.</p>
<h1 id="number-of-posts-per-event">Number of Posts per Event<a class="headerlink" href="#number-of-posts-per-event" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p><img alt="Count Post Per Event" src="images/CountPostPerEvent.png" title="Counts Post Per Event" width="700;"></p>
<p>The picture above shows the distribution of posts per event. #bodensee has
73,109 posts and takes the first place, the Bregenz Festival comes
second with 10,558 posts. From this it can be seen that the Bregenz
Festival seeks or gets a lot of publicity and spread, much more than
the other searched events. We will come back to this phenomenon
later to discuss it in
more detail. It is also important to mention that the remaining
cultural providers hardly stand out from the others in terms of the
number of posts. Although there was not much more than two months of
posts collected there is a lot more of posts about #bodensee.</p>

<p><img alt="Bregenz Festspiele post count over time" src="images/BregenzTime.png" title="Bregenz Festspiele post count over Time" width="700;"></p>
<p>Bregenz Festival is one of the main attractions of the Lake Constance
region. As shown earlier, it is also very present in Instagram with
over 10,000 posts. The distribution of the posts over time shows that
those in the summer have a peak and double every year, with Instagram
users increasing more linearly (additional 100 million every year:
https://www.statista.com/statistics/253577/number-of-monthly-active-instagram-users/
).
We also see an increased &ldquo;activity&rdquo; in March 2018 and 2019, probably
when the target audience starts to organize the summer holidays. We
see the most used words above. It is also interesting to see that we
started with German words, but we see many English terms. Here, in
such a touristic area, the question also arises whether a translation
of the terms would be interesting, e.g. lake Constance/lac de
Constance, to better capture their opinions.</p>
