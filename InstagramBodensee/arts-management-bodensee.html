<p><img alt="Bodensee Region - Culture" src="images/BodenseeKultur.png" title="Bodensee Region"></p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>We concluded an compelling interdisciplinary project on
the topic of digitalization, where we applied a selection of fundamental methods of data science: web
scraping, data wrangling with elastic search/kibana juggling,
data cleaning, counting, posing questions
and searching for answers in the data. We would like to
share some results on this blog.</p>
<p>The project was called "DIGITAL COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES FOR THE
CULTURAL SECTOR IN THE BODENSEE REGION", in which the data analysis module
dealt with the question of how digitalization was actually implemented. This was done
using the example of some cultural providers such as museums, galleries, exhibitions and theatres on the region of the Lake
Constance. We use in the terms Lake of
Constance region and Bodensee region interchangeably this article.</p>
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>A solid indicator of the extent to which cultural services like art
festivals, museums and theatres have gone digital is their social
media presence. It shows how
aware they are of their own image on the
Internet and how they actively handling it. With this in mind, a popular social media platform is
Instagram.</p>
<p>From a software engineering point of view, this platform is a perfect target since
it is easier to access data from there than from Facebook
or Twitter, for example, which is a great advantage since, say,  the
metadata provided is very helpful.
Furthermore, data privacy
is less concerning here since people know that it will be shared and
it is searchable by search engines. We
also gathered data which was only available without access restriction.</p>
<h1>Instagram</h1>
<p>Instagram is a social network service specialized in images.
Every day, 500 million users visit the platform, a total of 1
billion per month, as
<a href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/instagram-statistics/">this link</a>
shows. In Germany, Instagram is widely used with around <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1021975/instagram-users-germany/">20 million
users</a>
and we assume that this is also the case in the Bodensee region.</p>
<p>The
exchange between users takes place via so-called posts, which always consist of a
picture and a description or caption. Opportunities of further interactions are
given since users can leave comments on each
post and directly target other users with the "@" sign.</p>
<p>As pointed out earlier, Instagram focuses on images.  This limits the possibilities of user
posts, since some cultural providers do not allow pictures
of the exhibitions or performances to be taken. On the other hand, the
the cultural provider's public
relations activities   and the experience of the
visitors up to and after the exhibition/performance can be well
documented with photos in the posts. Therefore, we expect that  all selected cultural providers
are well represented.</p>
<h1>Data Collection</h1>
<p>First, a list of 210 cultural destinations and places, as well as 48
artists and 102 events relevant to the Lake Constance region was
compiled. Then we implemented a software routine to search for and
download relevant Instagram posts and the corresponding comments from
this list. The downloaded data was then stored in a database. Thus, by
the end of July 2019, a total of approximately 300,000 posts had been
collected. Unfortunately, #bodensee has more than 1
million post which takes a long time to gather. Thus, we
predominantely took data from  the months of June and July
2019 and only a very few samples (around 600 posts) from
months before that.</p>
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>We noticed that many of the posts were auxiliary ´noise´: For example, a
restaurant in Porto Alegre - Brazil - is called "Mainau", thus some
posts contain relevant text, but are not directly related to the Lake
Constance region. Also Mainau is only conditionally a cultural
provider but much more a touristic destination (in total 41.246 posts were connected
to Mainau). Although touristism and cultural providers are not mutually
exclusive we tried to differentiate here, especially, since including tourism
providers would go beyond the scope of the project.
So there are relations which could be referred to geographically or
thematically, but are not the ones we are searching for.
Therefore, we removed many such terms or refined the
search with an additional geographical attributes, so that in the end
a total of 128,188
posts were used for analysis. Nevertheless, we kept one very large
event, namely #bodensee, so that we can make comparisons with the
Bodensee region as a whole.   Because of the time limitation on this hashtag,  we will only discuss timelines relating
to the culture providers. Particularly in #bodensee, we expect a high
bias towards summer related events and topics.
In the analysis, we summarize all searched
terms of the list and only speak of searched events, if not explicitly
subdivided.</p>
<h1>Number of Posts per Event</h1>
<p><img alt="Count Post Per Event" src="images/CountPostPerEvent.png" title="Counts Post Per Event"></p>
<p>The picture above shows the distribution of posts per event. #bodensee has
73,109 posts and takes the first place, the Bregenz Festival comes
second with 10,558 posts. From this, it can be seen that the Bregenz
Festival seeks or gets a great deal of publicity and spread, much more than
the other searched events. We will come back to this phenomenon
later to discuss it in
more detail. It is also important to mention that the remaining
cultural providers hardly stand out from the others in terms of the
number of posts.</p>
<p><img alt="Counts Per Language" src="images/CountPerLanguage.png" title="Counts Per Language"></p>
<p>We also plotted the posts per language estimated, which can be very
'noisy' or contain irrelevant data.
This allows us to know which tourists visit see the events, although this can only be a
very rough estimate.
We see "lb" in third place, which mean that many posts were identified as from Luxembourg,
which is clearly a misclassification. When looking at these posts we can see that they are
from different languages (predominately German). We estimate that the use of "#" and different
languages or structures (like using spaces between the characters of a word, e.g. "S O M M E R") make
it very difficult to classify correctly a post to the language it belongs to. The graph is also similar
when excluding the #bodensee posts from the data.</p>
<!-- ![Counts Per Language without Bodensee](images/CountPerLanguage_without_Bodensee.png "Counts Per Language without Bodensee") -->

<h1>Geo-Location</h1>
<p><img alt="Distribution of posts over the world" src="images/world_distribution.png" title="Distribution of posts over the world"></p>
<p>We also plotted the geolocations of the posts against the world map
and we can see that many do not have any geolocation data (point on
the middle of the map). Also, there are many posts scattered all over
the globe. Nonetheless, most of the posts are actually from the
Bodensee region.</p>
<p><img alt="Distribution of posts over the Lake of Constance" src="images/dist_region.png" title="Distribution of posts over the Lake of Constance"></p>
<p>Looking closer, we see that the most posts come from the region of the
City of Constance. Bregenz comes second and then Friedrichshafen
follows. We also have
 many posts scattered all over the region.</p>
<p><img alt="Bregenz Festspiele post count over time" src="images/BregenzTime.png" title="Bregenz Festspiele post count over Time"></p>
<p>Bregenz Festival is one of the main attractions of the Lake Constance
region. As shown earlier, it is also very present on Instagram with
over 10,000 posts. The distribution of the posts over time shows that
those in the summer have a peak and double every year, with Instagram
users increasing almost linearly (Instagram itself gets additionally every year  100 million users:
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/253577/number-of-monthly-active-instagram-users/">www.statista.com: instagram users</a>
).
We also see an increased "activity" in March 2018 and 2019, when comparing to
previous years, probably
when the target audience starts to organize the summer holidays.</p>
<p><img alt="Bregenz Festspiele most used words" src="images/BregenzyMostUsedWords.png" title="Bregenz Festspiele most used words"></p>
<p>We
see the most used words above. It is also interesting to see that we
started with German words, but we see many English terms. Here, in
such a tourist destination, the question also arises whether a translation
of the terms would be insightful, e.g. Lake Constance/lac de
Constance, to better capture their opinions. This is particularly so since the
Bregenz Festival usually shows  Opera or Musicals and some are even in other
languages (e.g. French <a href="https://bregenzerfestspiele.com/de/programm/carmen">https://bregenzerfespiele.de/.../carmen</a> ).</p>

<p>In the table above, we see the 50 most used words with #BregenzerFestspiele and the new words added in 2018 and the new one
compared to 2018 and 2019, we can already see here that Opera Carmen
was in 2018 and Rigoletto in 2019. We can also see a phenomenon here
that is called hashtag hijacking. A <em>fruit and vegetable vendor</em> used
the hashtag #BregenzerFestspiele in April and May to promote his
market.</p>

<h1>Museum vs Theatre</h1>
<h3>Museum</h3>
<p><img alt="Counts For Museum" src="images/TimelinePostsMuseum.png" title="Counts For Museum"></p>
<h3>Theatre</h3>
<p><img alt="Counts For Theatre" src="images/TimelinePostsTheater.png" title="Counts For Theatre"></p>
<p>We have also analyzed the data concerning museums and theatres. In the compiled list were 87 museums and 15 theatres. 53 museums were found (i.e. 34 museums were not found), these have 11,205 posts. 8 theatres were found (the other 7 were written in another form or had no posts at all). In total there were 9,571 posts related to theatres.
For comparison, the word "theater" was only found in 3,300 posts and "museum" in 3,791, so although fewer theatres were found in the data collection - and generally recordings during the spectacle are  prohibited - the presence of theatres was slightly greater in Instagram.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Best Practices Recommendations</p>
<p>Here we have a list of general recommendations to cultural institutions to have an even greater impact on Instagram.</p>
<ul>
<li>Invite and otherwise involve Influencers or popular figures ("Super-spreaders") in the community of the cultural institution, if necessary seek interaction with the community with microinfluencer (own staff).</li>
<li>Use the summer planning season, when people are basically looking
    for destinations,  when possible</li>
<li>Address Zurich / Munich areas specifically, e.g. with #zürich</li>
<li>
<p>Engage the audience (e.g. in the form of posts/comments/also using targeting commands such as "@" in instagram/twitter)</p>
<ul>
<li>Other approaches to increase the "engagement rate" (sum of
    all likes to a contribution/follower number x 100) would be,
    for example, competitions with gifts (such as discount/free entry for best post) or artist "take overs".</li>
<li>Social media analysis tools can be used to track this data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Link/connect to other popular Instagram accounts, e.g. tourism agencies (also fall under the Super Spreaders):</p>
<ul>

<p>However, these recommendations are not intended to compare or replace a
market research and development of a social media strategy. This
includes the definition of objectives, target groups, content
and added value. For the definition of the target group,
classic segmentation and description criteria such as
demographics, socioeconomics and psychography can be taken
into account or "persona models" from marketing can be
used. When defining content and added value, some quality
criteria for good content must be also considered. These
include the fit with the overall strategy and image of the
cultural provider, the wishes and requirements of the target
group and the chosen channel. Furthermore, the content should
not be too promotional, should offer real added value and
interaction potential. Here, culture has an advantage in terms
of "instagramability" due to its own content production. For
example, it is easy to create aesthetic images of dance
performances for Instagram.</p>
